## Project Management
Click [here](https://github.com/orgs/NU394-s2025TTh/projects/6/views/1) to access our project backlog. The backlog is split into 2 different boards, the ["User Story Backlog"](https://github.com/orgs/NU394-s2025TTh/projects/6/views/1) and the ["Task Backlog"](https://github.com/orgs/NU394-s2025TTh/projects/6/views/7). 

The User Story backlog contains user scenarios and stories as issues. Issues for scenarios have their corresponding stories listed as sub-issues. Issues for stories display a prime number representing the size of the story.   

The Task backlog contains any technical work items completed by team members and identifies the primary tribe member who was responsible for implementing that work item. Any non-technical work items (such as client communication, product research, UI design, etc.) were instead communicated between tribe members and in written tribe meeting notes. See the subheading 'Additional Information and Documentation' below for where to find these meeting notes.
