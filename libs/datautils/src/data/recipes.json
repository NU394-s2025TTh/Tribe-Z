      "PREPARATION: Remove one 22-ounce (625g) ball Master Dough Without Starter (see book p.104) from refrigerator. Let warm to 50-55°F (approx. 1 hour).",
      "Grease Pan: Smear 2 tbsp room temp unsalted butter in an 8.5x12.25-inch seasoned black-steel Detroit pan. Spread 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil over butter.",
      "DOUGH IN PAN: Transfer dough to pan, flip to coat both sides with oil. Using fingertips, push dough outward to an even layer. Try to reach corners (don't worry if not perfect). Put pan in warm spot for 30 mins.",
      "Push dough again to fill corners and degas. Let rest 1-1.5 hours, until risen (timing depends on room temp). Do not press again if it shrinks.",
      "Preheat oven with two pizza stones/steels to 500°F for 1 hour. Make Tomato Sauce (see below or book p.131).",
      "TOMATO SAUCE: Combine 13 oz ground tomatoes (Tomato Magic/DiNapoli), 4.5 oz tomato paste (Bontá/Saporito), 1.5 tsp EVOO, pinch fine sea salt, pinch dried oregano. Puree with immersion blender. Set aside.",
      "FIRST BAKE: Place pizza pan on TOP stone. Bake 6 mins (dough will set, lightly colored).",
      "ADD CHEESE: Remove from oven. Sprinkle 7 oz shredded brick cheese evenly to edges. Stack 1.75 cups (170g) of 7 oz total shredded white Cheddar (e.g., Cabot) around edges (to rise up sides). Sprinkle remaining Cheddar over top.",
      "SECOND BAKE: Return pan to TOP stone. Bake ~7 mins (pizza lightly colored, cheese bubbling on sides). Rotate pan 180 degrees, transfer to BOTTOM stone. Bake 8-9 mins, until edge cheese is charred.",
      "SAUCE & SERVE: Meanwhile, heat tomato sauce over medium-low heat. Remove pizza from oven. Use long metal spatula to loosen sides, remove pizza to cutting board. Cut into 4 quarters. Ladle 2 vertical 'racing stripes' of hot tomato sauce down length, spread slightly. Finish with dusting of Pecorino Romano, dried oregano, and a drizzle of Garlic Oil (see book p.70).",
      "Garlic Oil (Quick Ref): Combine 1.5 tsp minced garlic with 1/4 cup EVOO. Refrigerate."

      "PREPARE DOUGH & OVEN: Use one 14-ounce (400g) ball Sicilian Dough Without Starter (see book p.221 for small batch). Let dough warm to 60-65°F. Preheat conventional oven with two stones/steels to 500°F for 1 hour. If using, prepare wood-fired oven (see book p.344).",
      "PRESS DOUGH IN PAN: Pour 2 tbsp olive oil into an 8-inch square steel pan. Release sticky dough into pan, flip to coat. Press dough to fill pan, let rest uncovered in warm spot 30 mins. Press again to corners. Rest 1 hour more until risen near rim.",
      "DEEP FRYER SETUP: Pour canola oil to 2-inch depth in a wide, deep pot (at least 10in wide, 6in deep). Heat to 350°F. Set cooling rack over sheet pan nearby.",
      "FIRST BAKE (CONVENTIONAL OVEN): Place pan with dough on BOTTOM stone. Bake 7 mins (top golden, bottom richer brown). Remove pan, turn pizza over (still in pan). Rest 2 mins to flatten top.",
      "DEEP FRY: Carefully transfer crust, top side down, to hot oil. Fry 2.5-3 mins until underside is browned. Using tongs, flip, fry 2.5 mins more until second side browned. Transfer to cooling rack.",
      "TOP & SECOND BAKE (CONVENTIONAL OVEN): Arrange 4 oz sliced whole-milk mozzarella over fried crust (1/2-inch border). Spoon generous 1/2 cup Sicilian Tomato Sauce (book p.233) over cheese, spread. Sprinkle with 1/2 tsp chopped garlic. Using a peel, set pizza on TOP stone for ~2 mins to melt cheese.",
      "THIRD BAKE (WOOD-FIRED OVEN - OPTIONAL): Lift pizza with long-handled metal peel. Hold towards wood fire (if using), ~10 inches from flame, to crisp one edge. Rotate on peel to crisp all edges (~30 secs total - doming technique). If no wood oven, this step is skipped (becomes Tre Forni).",
      "FINISH & SERVE: Transfer to cutting board. Cut into 4 squares. Dust with Pecorino Romano and dried oregano. Drizzle with Garlic Oil (book p.70). Drape 1 slice of prosciutto over each square (optional).",
