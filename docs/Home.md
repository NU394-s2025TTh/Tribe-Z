# Purpose

This is the overview of the project documentation for Tribe Z, which is composed of Team Green and Team Purple. Tribe Z is working with Ian Gibbs and Bob Rapp as clients. Please see below for links to other documentation files detailing the members of each team, client information, and tribe practices.

# Key Elements of the Tribe Project Documentation

Additionally, the home page should link to an area for the tribe's [Organizational Practices](Organizational-Practices.md), [Development Practices](Development-Practices.md), and [Client Information](Client-Information.md).

Go to the [Architecture Overview](Architecture-Overview.md) to see how this application is structured at a high level

# Attribution

to help with attributing work in the project documentation; please indicate who and what team worked on authoring the page, e.g. (written by team gray @toddwseattle). Project Documentations are repos; so the commits can help with who authored what but we expect you to collaborate so the commits will only sort of be representative. If a "guild" is working on a page, create a page indicating who is in the guild that authored the page; e.g.
