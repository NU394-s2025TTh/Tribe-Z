## How stories and work items are recorded in the backlog

What the process for this is.

# How are stories and work items prioritized?

P0 - highest priority: show-stopper bug or must-have features 
P1 - medium priority
P2 - lowest priority: nice-to-have features

# How are stories and work items estimated?

Based on how much time it would take to complete. Different buckets for each time commitment small (1 hour fix) through large (>6 hour fix)

# How are stories and work items assigned to team members?

Volunteering for tasks but also making sure each person has no more than 3 tasks in progress.

# How are stories and work items tracked?

Github Projects 

# How are stories and work items reported on?

Github Projects. Potential work items are identified by the team, ensured they're relevant by the product owners, and scoped by the architects 

# How are stories and work items archived?

Github Projects -- if we decide as a team that we want to archive something, we will move it to the Archived section on our board
